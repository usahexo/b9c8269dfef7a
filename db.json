The aim of the game is to accumulate as many slices as possible, with the goal being to reach 88 slices.\n\nThe game is played using a standard deck of 52 cards, with Ace being worth 1 point, 2 through 10 being worth face value, and Jack, Queen and King being worth 10 points each. A player starts by placing a bet, and then receives two cards. They must then decide whether to \"hit\" (take another card) or \"stand\" (stick with the current total). If the player busts (goes over 21), they lose their bet.\n\nIf the player has a total of 21 or more, they win regardless of the dealer's total. If the player has a total lower than 21, their final score is compared to the dealer's final score. If the player's total is higher, they win; if the dealer's total is higher, they lose.\n\nPlayers can also choose to double down on any two cards (ie double their bet and receive one more card). If they choose to do this, they must stand however even if their new total is lower than 21. Once all players have had their turn, the dealer flips over their second card and completes their hand. The dealer must hit on totals of 16 or less and stand on totals of 17 or more.\n\nThat's all there is to it! Give Alpha88 pizza blackjack a try at your favourite online casino today.\n\n#  What is Lucky Streak? \n\nLucky Streak is an online casino game that allows players to win real money prizes.

The objective of the game is to accumulate as many pizza slices as possible by betting on individual cards, with the aim of reaching 21 points or closer to 21 than the dealer without exceeding it.\n\nIn regular blackjack, the player competes against the dealer to see who can reach 21 or come closest without going over. With pizza blackjack Zimbabwe, each player starts with a certain amount of pizza slices and bets against other players in order to win more slices. The game can be played with any number of players, but typically two to four people work best.\n\nThe dealer deals two cards to each player and two cards to him/herself. The Ace is worth 1 point, 2 through 10 are worth face value, and the Jack, Queen and King are each worth 10 points. Players then take turns either taking another card (hit) or sticking with what they have (stand). Once all players have either hit or stood, the dealer flips over his/her second card. If the dealer’s total is 17 or more, he must stand; if it’s 16 or less, he must hit.\n\nPlayers win one pizza slice for every point their hand is worth greater than the dealer’s hand (for example, if your hand is worth 18 and the dealer has a total of 14, you would win 4 slices). If both you and the dealer have exactly 21 points (a “push”), neither player wins nor loses any slices. The first person to run out of pizza slices loses the game.\n\nSome variations of pizza blackjack Zimbabwe include allowing players to split pairs (so that they can play two hands at once) and allowing them to double down (double their bet in exchange for just one more card).\n\n#  Where can I play Alpha88 pizza blackjack? \n\nAlpha88 is a popular online casino that offers a variety of games, including blackjack.
