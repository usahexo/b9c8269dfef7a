Quarterback Cam Newton is a two-time MVP, and linebacker Luke Kuechly is one of the best defensive players in the league. They also have a strong coaching staff, led by head coach Ron Rivera.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest reason to root for the Panthers is their community involvement.

The aim of the game is to accumulate as many slices as possible, with the goal being to reach 88 slices.\n\nThe game is played using a standard deck of 52 cards, with Ace being worth 1 point, 2 through 10 being worth face value, and Jack, Queen and King being worth 10 points each.

The objective of the game is to accumulate as many pizza slices as possible by betting on individual cards, with the aim of reaching 21 points or closer to 21 than the dealer without exceeding it.\n\nIn regular blackjack, the player competes against the dealer to see who can reach 21 or come closest without going over. With pizza blackjack Zimbabwe, each player starts with a certain amount of pizza slices and bets against other players in order to win more slices. The game can be played with any number of players, but typically two to four people work best.\n\nThe dealer deals two cards to each player and two cards to him/herself. The Ace is worth 1 point, 2 through 10 are worth face value, and the Jack, Queen and King are each worth 10 points. Players then take turns either taking another card (hit) or sticking with what they have (stand). Once all players have either hit or stood, the dealer flips over his/her second card. If the dealer’s total is 17 or more, he must stand; if it’s 16 or less, he must hit.\n\nPlayers win one pizza slice for every point their hand is worth greater than the dealer’s hand (for example, if your hand is worth 18 and the dealer has a total of 14, you would win 4 slices). If both you and the dealer have exactly 21 points (a “push”), neither player wins nor loses any slices. The first person to run out of pizza slices loses the game.\n\nSome variations of pizza blackjack Zimbabwe include allowing players to split pairs (so that they can play two hands at once) and allowing them to double down (double their bet in exchange for just one more card).\n\n#  Where can I play Alpha88 pizza blackjack? \n\nAlpha88 is a popular online casino that offers a variety of games, including blackjack.

The basic idea is to create two poker hands out of the seven cards that you are dealt - one five card hand and one two card hand. The five card hand must rank higher than the two card hand.\n\nYour objective is to win both hands against the dealer's hands. If you win one hand and lose the other, or if both hands are ties, then you only get your bet back. If you lose both hands, then you lose your entire bet.\n\n# How do I play?\n\nIn order to play Pai Gow, you first need to place a bet. You can either bet on each individual hand, or you can place a \"combination\" bet which will cover all possibilities - win both hands, lose both hands, or win one and tie the other.\n\nAfter placing your bet, you are dealt seven cards face down. You then need to create two poker hands - a five card hand and a two card hand. The five card hand must rank higher than the two card hand.\n\nYour objective is to win both hands against the dealer's hands. If you win one hand and lose the other, or if both hands are ties, then you only get your bet back. If you lose both hands, then you lose your entire bet.\n\n# The different variations of Pai Gow\n\n\nThere are a few different variations of Pai Gow that you can find in casinos:\n\n \n- Classic Pai Gow: This is the original version of the game where players try to make two poker hands - a five card hand and a two card hand. The five card hand must rank higher than the two card hand. \n- Progressive Pai Gow: In this variation, players are trying to make two poker hands - a five card hand and a four card hand. The four card hand must rank higher than the two card hand. \n- Chinese Poker: This version is similar to classic Paigow, but with some differences. In Chinese Poker, players are dealt thirteen cards instead of seven cards. They must then split these cards into three poker hands - one five card hand, one six-card hand and one three-card highstraight (Ace through six). Straights and flushes do not count in Chinese Poker. \n\nThere are also some variations of Pai Gow that can be played online:\n\n \n- Fortune Pai Gow Poker: This variation is similar to regular Pai Gow Poker, but features an optional bonus side Bet called \" Fortune Bonus\". If you make a Royal Flush with your first five cards (or 4-of-a-kind or straight flush), you automatically win the Fortune Bonus even if your opponent has better poker hands with their remaining cards). \n- Ultimate Texas Hold'em: In this variation, players compete against the dealer in a standard Texas Hold'em game plus an optional bonus side Bet called \"Bonus\". If players achieve certain rankings with their final five cards (e.g., Royal Flush), they win the Bonus payout\n\n# How to play Pai Gow online?\n\nPai Gow is one of the oldest casino games that are still played today. The game is believed to have originated in China almost two thousand years ago. Pai Gow is a tile-based game that is similar to Mahjong. The game can be played with anywhere from two to six players. In Pai Gow, each player is dealt seven tiles. The players then take turns forming two hands using their tiles - a five-card poker hand and a two-card hand. The five-card hand must rank higher than the two-card hand. The player whose hands rank the highest wins the pot.\n\nIf you're interested in playing Pai Gow online, there are a few things you need to know. First, there are a number of different variations of the game available online, so make sure you understand the rules before you start playing. Also, make sure you're playing at a reputable site - there are plenty of scam sites out there that will just take your money without giving you anything in return.\n\nWhen you're ready to start playing, head to the casino lobby and look for a Pai Gow table. You can usually find tables that accommodate anywhere from two to six players. Choose a table and click on it to join the game. Once you're seated, the dealer will give each player seven tiles and place the remaining tiles in the middle of the table.\n\nThe object of Pai Gow is to form two hands using your seven tiles - a five-card poker hand and a two-card hand. The five-card hand must rank higher than the two-card hand. Once all players have formed their hands, the dealer will reveal his or her cards and compare them against each player's hands. The player with the best five-card poker hand wins the pot, while the player with the best two-card hand loses any money they've bet on that particular round. If both hands are equal, then the pot is split between all winners equally.\n\n# Playing Pai Gow online\n\nNow that you know how to play Pai Gow, it's time to learn how to play it online! Like we said earlier, there are a number of different variations of this game available online, so make sure you understand the rules before you start playing. Most online casinos offer both American and European versions of Pai Gow, so be sure to choose the version that best suits your needs.\n\nAlso, be aware that not all casinos offer free play modes - some casinos require you to bet real money in order to play their games. So if you're new to Pai Gow or just want to practice for free before betting actual money, be sure to find an online casino that offers a free play mode first.\n\nOnce you've found an online casino that meets your needs, head over to their lobby and look for a Pai Gow table. You'll usually find tables that accommodate anywhere from 2-6 players. Choose a table and click on it to join the game (you may have to create an account if this is your first time playing at this casino). Once you're seated, the dealer will give each player seven tiles and place any remaining tiles in the middle of the table - this is where all betting takes place during this particular round of play).\n\n     Now it's time for you to begin constructing your hands! We'll explain how this works below: \n\n   20% Hand: This is your low card kicker . Any 2 cards totaling less than 10 (e . g . 4 & 6) . This will only ever count as 1 card towards your 5 card poker hand .\n\n    4 card Poker Hand: This will comprise any 3 cards from among those dealt face up plus either your 20% Hand or another 2 card combination totalling more than 10 giving 4 combinations possible altogether as shown :\n\n  A ) { Ace , King } , { 2 , 3 }  OR { Ace , 2 } , { King , 3 } - Called either \"Ace high\" or \"2 high\" ;\n\n B ) { Ace , King } , { Jack , 10 }  OR { Ace , Jack } , { King , 10 } - Called either \"Ace low\" or \"King low\" ;\n\n C ) { Ace , King } , { 4 , 5 }  OR { Ace , 5 } ; { King ; 4 } – Pair Play as pair only ;\n\n D ) ANY other combination totalling 11+ using exactly 3 cards from among those dealt . This gives us 16 possible four card combinations altogether .\n\n 5 Card Poker Hand :Combine any 3 different cards from among those dealt PLUS either your 20% Hand or another 2 card combination totalling more than 10 giving 5 combinations possible altogether as shown :\n\n E ) ANY pair using exactly 2 cards from among those dealt ; FIVE other possible 3 card combinations making 6 combinations in total from among those dealt .\n\n# What is the objective of the game?\n\nThe objective of the game is to score as many points as possible. Points are earned by hitting the ball into designated areas of the court.\n\n# What type of racquet do I need?\n\nThere is no specific type of racquet needed for this game; however, a light and flexible racquet is ideal.\n\n# How do I serve the ball?\n\nTo serve the ball, stand with one foot behind the baseline and hold the racquet in your dominant hand. Swing your arm forward and snap your wrist to toss the ball into the air. As the ball approaches its highest point, hit it with your racquet. The ball should bounce once before you hit it back across the net.\n\n# What are the basic rules of tennis?\n\nTennis has very simple rules - hit the ball over the net and into your opponent's side of the court. If they cannot hit it back, then you win a point. If they can hit it back, then you continue playing until someone misses or hits it out-of-bounds. The first player to reach six or seven points (depending on if it is a doubles or singles match), wins that game and scores a point for their team (or themselves). The first player to win four games wins the set, and if it is a best-of-three sets match, then they player must win two sets to win overall.\n\n# What are good Pai Gow hands? \n\nThere is no definitive answer to this question, as different players may have their own preferences, but there are some hands that are generally considered to be better than others. \n\nSome of the strongest Pai Gow hands include a five card straight, a five card flush, three of a kind, and a four card royal flush. While these hands offer some of the best odds, they can be difficult to form, so it is important to be aware of the other possible hands that can be played. \n\nSome of the weaker hands include two pair and one pair, but even these can provide some chances for winning if they are matched against weak hands from the dealer. In general, it is important to remember that the object of Pai Gow Poker is to create two winning hands out of the seven cards available, so any hand that offers a chance at victory should be played.\n\n# What are the best Pai Gow tips?\n\nThe best Pai Gow tips are to always bet the banker and to only split Aces if you have another Ace to go with it. Playing these two tips will give you the best chance of winning at Pai Gow.\n\nWhen playing the banker, you want to ensure that you are getting the best odds possible. The banker has a house edge of just over 1%, while the player has a house edge of over 2%. By betting on the banker, you are increasing your chances of winning while also reducing your chances of losing.\n\nSplitting Aces is also a good idea, as long as you have another Ace to go with it. If you don’t have another Ace, then it’s best to keep them together. When splitting Aces, you should always bet equal amounts on each hand. This will give you the best chance of winning both hands and walking away with some extra cash.","source":"_posts/What-are-the-Pai-Gow-rules.md","raw":"---\ntitle: What are the Pai Gow rules\ndate: 2022-09-28 23:00:24\ncategories:\n- Alpha88\ntags:\n---\n\n\n# What are the Pai Gow rules?\n\nThe Pai Gow rules are very simple, but there is a fair amount of strategy involved in playing the game.

Once you're seated, the dealer will give each player seven tiles and place the remaining tiles in the middle of the table.\n\nThe object of Pai Gow is to form two hands using your seven tiles - a five-card poker hand and a two-card hand. The five-card hand must rank higher than the two-card hand. Once all players have formed their hands, the dealer will reveal his or her cards and compare them against each player's hands. The player with the best five-card poker hand wins the pot, while the player with the best two-card hand loses any money they've bet on that particular round. If both hands are equal, then the pot is split between all winners equally.\n\n# Playing Pai Gow online\n\nNow that you know how to play Pai Gow, it's time to learn how to play it online! Like we said earlier, there are a number of different variations of this game available online, so make sure you understand the rules before you start playing. Most online casinos offer both American and European versions of Pai Gow, so be sure to choose the version that best suits your needs.\n\nAlso, be aware that not all casinos offer free play modes - some casinos require you to bet real money in order to play their games. So if you're new to Pai Gow or just want to practice for free before betting actual money, be sure to find an online casino that offers a free play mode first.\n\nOnce you've found an online casino that meets your needs, head over to their lobby and look for a Pai Gow table. You'll usually find tables that accommodate anywhere from 2-6 players. Choose a table and click on it to join the game (you may have to create an account if this is your first time playing at this casino). Once you're seated, the dealer will give each player seven tiles and place any remaining tiles in the middle of the table - this is where all betting takes place during this particular round of play).\n\n     Now it's time for you to begin constructing your hands! We'll explain how this works below: \n\n   20% Hand: This is your low card kicker . Any 2 cards totaling less than 10 (e . g . 4 & 6) . This will only ever count as 1 card towards your 5 card poker hand .\n\n    4 card Poker Hand: This will comprise any 3 cards from among those dealt face up plus either your 20% Hand or another 2 card combination totalling more than 10 giving 4 combinations possible altogether as shown :\n\n  A ) { Ace , King } , { 2 , 3 }  OR { Ace , 2 } , { King , 3 } - Called either \"Ace high\" or \"2 high\" ;\n\n B ) { Ace , King } , { Jack , 10 }  OR { Ace , Jack } , { King , 10 } - Called either \"Ace low\" or \"King low\" ;\n\n C ) { Ace , King } , { 4 , 5 }  OR { Ace , 5 } ; { King ; 4 } – Pair Play as pair only ;\n\n D ) ANY other combination totalling 11+ using exactly 3 cards from among those dealt . This gives us 16 possible four card combinations altogether .\n\n 5 Card Poker Hand :Combine any 3 different cards from among those dealt PLUS either your 20% Hand or another 2 card combination totalling more than 10 giving 5 combinations possible altogether as shown :\n\n E ) ANY pair using exactly 2 cards from among those dealt ; FIVE other possible 3 card combinations making 6 combinations in total from among those dealt .\n\n# What is the objective of the game?\n\nThe objective of the game is to score as many points as possible. Points are earned by hitting the ball into designated areas of the court.\n\n# What type of racquet do I need?\n\nThere is no specific type of racquet needed for this game; however, a light and flexible racquet is ideal.\n\n# How do I serve the ball?\n\nTo serve the ball, stand with one foot behind the baseline and hold the racquet in your dominant hand. Swing your arm forward and snap your wrist to toss the ball into the air. As the ball approaches its highest point, hit it with your racquet. The ball should bounce once before you hit it back across the net.\n\n# What are the basic rules of tennis?\n\nTennis has very simple rules - hit the ball over the net and into your opponent's side of the court. If they cannot hit it back, then you win a point. If they can hit it back, then you continue playing until someone misses or hits it out-of-bounds. The first player to reach six or seven points (depending on if it is a doubles or singles match), wins that game and scores a point for their team (or themselves). The first player to win four games wins the set, and if it is a best-of-three sets match, then they player must win two sets to win overall.\n\n# What are good Pai Gow hands? \n\nThere is no definitive answer to this question, as different players may have their own preferences, but there are some hands that are generally considered to be better than others. \n\nSome of the strongest Pai Gow hands include a five card straight, a five card flush, three of a kind, and a four card royal flush. While these hands offer some of the best odds, they can be difficult to form, so it is important to be aware of the other possible hands that can be played. \n\nSome of the weaker hands include two pair and one pair, but even these can provide some chances for winning if they are matched against weak hands from the dealer. In general, it is important to remember that the object of Pai Gow Poker is to create two winning hands out of the seven cards available, so any hand that offers a chance at victory should be played.\n\n# What are the best Pai Gow tips?\n\nThe best Pai Gow tips are to always bet the banker and to only split Aces if you have another Ace to go with it. Playing these two tips will give you the best chance of winning at Pai Gow.\n\nWhen playing the banker, you want to ensure that you are getting the best odds possible. The banker has a house edge of just over 1%, while the player has a house edge of over 2%. By betting on the banker, you are increasing your chances of winning while also reducing your chances of losing.\n\nSplitting Aces is also a good idea, as long as you have another Ace to go with it. If you don’t have another Ace, then it’s best to keep them together. When splitting Aces, you should always bet equal amounts on each hand. This will give you the best chance of winning both hands and walking away with some extra cash.","slug":"What-are-the-Pai-Gow-rules","published":1,"updated":"2022-09-28T15:00:24.957Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cl8lr87nf0000n4v5bbpc32z8","content":"<h1 id=\"What-are-the-Pai-Gow-rules\"><a href=\"#What-are-the-Pai-Gow-rules\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What are the Pai Gow rules?\"></a>What are the Pai Gow rules?</h1><p>The Pai Gow rules are very simple, but there is a fair amount of strategy involved in playing the game.

This will give you the best chance of winning both hands and walking away with some extra cash.</p>\n"},{"title":"Just how many dice must be used to play craps in Rhode Island","date":"2022-10-05T08:33:52.000Z","_content":"\n\n#  Just how many dice must be used to play craps in Rhode Island?\n\nFor those who may be wondering, the answer is that a total of three dice are needed in craps game play when situated in Rhode Island. This specific information is based on the ruleset found at Twin River Casino, which is located in Lincoln. If you're looking to try your luck at this classic casino game while in the state, you now know exactly what you'll need on hand!\n\n#  Just what are the principles of the game?\n\n## The basics\n\nFootball is a sport that has simple basic rules, but can be difficult to master. The object of the game is to score more points than your opponent by advancing the ball down the field and into the end zone. The ball can be moved down the field either by running with it or passing it to a teammate. Teams have four attempts, known as downs, to move the ball 10 yards downfield. If they are not successful, they must surrender possession of the ball to their opponents.\n\n## Scoring\n\nThere are several ways to score points in football. The most common way is by running or passing the ball into the end zone. Another way is by kicking a field goal, which is a kick made through the uprights of the opposing team’s goal post. A touchdown is worth 6 points, while a field goal is worth 3 points. Extra point kicks are worth 1 point, and they can be either run or kicked after touchdowns.\n\n## Strategy\n\nThere is a lot of strategy involved in football. Teams must decide whether to try for a first down or punt on fourth down, whether to pass or run the ball, and how best to attack the other team’s defense. Coaches must also make strategic decisions about when and where to use their timeouts.\n\n#  Where can you locate a casino that uses this type of wagering?\n\nIf you're searching for a casino that uses this type of wagering, your best bet is to look online. There are a number of different casinos that offer this type of gambling, so it's important to do your research in order to find the one that's right for you.\n\nWhen looking for a casino that offers Yggdrasil Gaming slots, be sure to consider the bonuses and promotions that are offered. Many of these casinos will offer sign-up bonuses, as well as bonuses for loyalty members. You should also compare the payout percentages and other features offered by each casino before making a decision.\n\nConsider the following factors when choosing a casino that offers Yggdrasil Gaming slots:\n\n-The sign-up bonus\n-The loyalty bonus program\n-The payout percentage\n-Other features offered by the casino\n\n#  How much money could you win if the right bet is made?\n\nGambling can be a fun and exciting way to pass the time, but it can also be lucrative. If you’re looking to make some serious money, you need to know what bets offer the best odds.\n\nSome bets have better odds than others, and if you’re looking to make a large amount of money with relatively low risk, you should consider placing a bet on one of these.\n\n# The most common type of bet is the straight bet. This is when you simply choose a horse or team to win. The odds for this type of bet are typically quite low, so it’s not a great option if you’re looking to make a lot of money.\n\n# Another common type of bet is the parlay . With a parlay, you bet on two or more teams or horses to win, and the payout is significantly higher than with a straight bet. However, the odds of winning are lower than with a straight bet.\n\n# If you’re looking for greater odds and potential payouts, consider an accumulator . An accumulator is similar to a parlay, but with more teams or horses involved. This offers significantly higher payouts but also comes with significantly lower odds.\n\n# One final option for those looking to make big bucks through gambling is prop betting . Prop betting involves betting on specific occurrences during a game rather than who will win or lose. This can come with high rewards, but it also comes with high risks.\n\n#  What should you do if you don't understand a bet?\n\nIf you're not sure what a particular bet means, it's best to ask the dealer or another player for clarification. If you still don't understand after asking around, don't place the bet - it's simply not worth the risk.","source":"_posts/Just-how-many-dice-must-be-used-to-play-craps-in-Rhode-Island.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Just how many dice must be used to play craps in Rhode Island\ndate: 2022-10-05 16:33:52\ncategories:\n- Play Craps\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  Just how many dice must be used to play craps in Rhode Island?\n\nFor those who may be wondering, the answer is that a total of three dice are needed in craps game play when situated in Rhode Island.

There may be specific requirements pertaining to the size of the facility, the number of gaming machines that can be installed, or the amount of capital you must have on hand. You will also need to obtain a license from the relevant government agency.\n\nThe next step is to secure a location for your casino.

You'll need slot machines, blackjack tables, roulette wheels, and more. You'll also need staff to run the casino—servers, dealers, croupiers, etc.—as well as security personnel to keep things running smoothly.\n\nStarting your own casino can be a challenging but rewarding venture.

This may seem like a no-brainer, but it’s important to know all the ins and outs of blackjack before you start playing. There are many different variations of the game, so make sure you understand the basic rules before playing for real money.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Make a plan and stick to it. Like any other type of gambling, blackjack is all about making good decisions based on probability. Before you start playing, decide how much you want to bet and stick to that limit. Don’t get swept up in the excitement of the game and end up betting more than you can afford to lose.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Use basic strategy charts. Basic strategy charts are a great way to improve your odds at blackjack. These charts outline the best way to play each hand, depending on the cards that are dealt. Memorizing a basic strategy chart can help you make better decisions while playing and give you a better chance to win.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Stay patient and don’t rush your decisions. One of the biggest mistakes beginners make at blackjack is trying to do too much too soon. When you’re just starting out, take your time and only make moves when you’re sure of what you’re doing. Rushing your decisions can lead to costly mistakes and decreased odds of winning.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>practice makes perfect! The best way to improve your blackjack skills is by practicing as much as possible. There are many online casinos that offer free versions of blackjack where you can practice without risking any real money . Once you feel comfortable with the game, move on to playing for real cash prizes</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1 id=\"How-to-Create-an-Authentic-Casino-Gaming-Experience-in-Your-Own-Home\"><a href=\"#How-to-Create-an-Authentic-Casino-Gaming-Experience-in-Your-Own-Home\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How to Create an Authentic Casino Gaming Experience in Your Own Home\"></a>How to Create an Authentic Casino Gaming Experience in Your Own Home</h1><p>Creating a casino gaming experience at home can be fun and exhilarating, but it’s important to make sure that you set up the space correctly in order to replicate the real thing as closely as possible. Here are a few tips on how to do just that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Choose the right space: The first step is to choose the right space for your casino gaming area. Ideally, you want a room with lots of natural light and plenty of open floor space. If you don’t have an entire room to dedicate to the project, consider using a spare bedroom or even just part of a room.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Create a gaming zone: Once you’ve chosen the right space, it’s time to create your gaming zone. This is essentially the boundaries of your casino gaming area, and should be marked off with some type of boundary (e.g., tape, rope, furniture). Make sure that the area is large enough to accommodate all of your guests comfortably.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Add some casino atmosphere: Now that you’ve created your gaming zone, it’s time to start adding some casino atmosphere. This can include things like decorations, lighting, music and aromatherapy. Be creative and think about ways to make your guests feel like they’re really in a casino.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Set up the game tables: The next step is to set up the game tables. If you’re not sure how to do this, there are plenty of online tutorials available that can show you how. Make sure that each table is set up according to the game’s official rules.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Deal the cards: The final touch is dealing out the cards! This can be done by either you or one of your guests. Just make sure that everyone knows the game’s rules before starting.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With these tips in mind, you should be able to create an authentic casino gaming experience right in your own home!</p>\n<h1 id=\"Get-GTAN-on-the-Net-for-Casino-Development-Pizza-Delivery-and-Blackjack-Tips\"><a href=\"#Get-GTAN-on-the-Net-for-Casino-Development-Pizza-Delivery-and-Blackjack-Tips\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Get GTAN on the Net for Casino Development, Pizza Delivery, and Blackjack Tips!\"></a>Get GTAN on the Net for Casino Development, Pizza Delivery, and Blackjack Tips!</h1><p>GTAN is an online community that focuses on providing the best content for casino development, pizza delivery, and blackjack tips.
