#  How many several 5-card poker hands would simply contain clubs?

There are 3 clubs in a deck of 52 cards. So, there are 3 possibilities for the first card, 2 possibilities for the second card, 1 possibility for the third card, and 0 possibilities for the fourth and fifth cards. This means that there are 3*2*1*0 = 6 different 5-card poker hands that contain clubs.

#  How many several 5-card poker hands would contain two spades? 

This problem can be solved by calculating the number of 5-card poker hands that do not contain any spades and subtracting this from the total number of 5-card poker hands.

There are 52! (or 3,628,800) possible 5-card poker hands. However, only half of these hands (26!) would not contain any spades. Therefore, the answer is 26 * 4 = 104.

#  How many several 5-card poker hands would contain three hearts? 

There are thirteen 5-card poker hands with three hearts.

#  How many several 5-card poker hands would contain four clubs?

There are \( C_{52} = 2,598,960 \) different 5-card poker hands.

If we want to find the number of poker hands with four clubs, we can use the combination formula:

\( n! / (r!)(s!)\)

Where:

n is the number of items in the set
r is the number of items chosen at a times is the number of selections that can be made from n items.

In this case, n = 4, r = 1, and s = 3. So the combination formula becomes:

\( 4! / (1!)(3!) = 24 \)

#  How many several 5-card poker hands would contain five hearts?

There are 10 possibilities for the first card, 9 possibilities for the second, and then 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 for the last three. So there are 10 * 9 * 8 = 720 possible five-card hands that contain five hearts.
