#  The Perfect Addition to your Casino Collection: Haiti!

If you are like most casino enthusiasts, you have a nice collection of games that you love to play. However, if you are looking for something new and exciting to add to your repertoire, you should consider adding Haiti to your list! This little-known game is quickly gaining popularity due to its unique and exciting gameplay.

Haiti is a card game that is played with a standard deck of 52 cards. The object of the game is to take all of the cards from your opponent. The game is played in rounds, and the player who takes the last card in a round starts the next round.

The game begins with both players drawing cards until they each have four. The player with the highest card then starts the action. They may either put one card on the table, or they may put two cards on the table and take one back. If they put two cards on the table and take one back, they must put the two new cards together to create a five-card hand.

The second player then has one of two options: either put one card on the table or put two cards on the table and take one back. If they put two cards on the table and take one back, they must again create a five-card hand. This process continues until all of the cards have been played. The winner is the player who takes all of their opponent's cards.

This game can be played with anywhere from 2-4 players, making it perfect for any size gathering. It's also great for gamers of all ages, as it can be adapted to fit any skill level. So if you're looking for something new and exciting to add to your casino collection, be sure to give Haiti a try!
