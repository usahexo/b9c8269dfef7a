Snow Scratcher is a winter-themed scratch card game that gives players the opportunity to win big. With its 5x5 grid, there are plenty of ways to win, and the $10,000 top prize is definitely something to aspire to.

Although the game can be played for free, for real money prizes you need to be a registered player at one of the licensed online casinos that offer Snow Scratcher.

To play, simply choose your bet amount and then click on any two squares on the grid. If they match, you'll win that prize amount - simple as that! Prizes are cumulative so if you match two squares with different amounts, you'll still only win the higher of the two.

If you're lucky enough to match three squares in a row, diagonal or square - regardless of value - then you'll automatically win the jackpot! Just think about what you could do with all that cash...

Snow Scratcher is an easy game to play but hard to master, so give it a go today and see if you can hit the jackpot!
