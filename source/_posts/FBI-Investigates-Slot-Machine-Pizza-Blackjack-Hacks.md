#  FBI Investigates Slot Machine Pizza Blackjack Hacks

The FBI has launched an investigation into allegations of a group of pizza hackers who have allegedly been cheating at blackjack in Las Vegas casinos by using slot machines to generate illegitimate winning tickets.

Sources close to the investigation say that the hackers have been taking advantage of a loophole in the software used in many slot machines that allows them to produce bogus tickets that can be cashed out for real money.

The FBI is said to be looking into how the group managed to get their hands on the software needed to exploit the loophole, and whether or not any casino employees were complicit in the scheme.

So far, no arrests have been made, but agents are said to be getting close to identifying the suspects.

#  Slot Machine Pizza Blackjack Sites Being Shutdown

Slot machine sites and blackjack sites are being shutdown. The crackdown has been made in an effort to protect players, who are reportedly losing millions of dollars to unregulated sites.

"The industry has problems with a high degree of fraud," said IAGO CEO Andre Wilsenach. "Players are losing money, and the industry is not doing enough to stop it."

The shutdowns are part of a two-year plan that will also see the closure of unlicensed sports betting and casino sites. It's hoped that the closures will help to create a more regulated market for online gambling in South Africa.

While some operators are welcoming the move, others feel that it will have a negative impact on their businesses. Slot machines and blackjack were two of the most popular forms of online gambling in South Africa, so the closures could lead to a decline in revenue for the industry as a whole.

"We have been operating legally and we have always abided by the rules set out by regulators," said one site operator. "Now we're faced with shutting down or moving offshore – neither of which is ideal."

#  Online Casino operators losing millions to hackers

Online casino operators are losing millions to hackers, with some reporting losses in the region of $1 million per day, according to a new report.

The study by cybersecurity firm McAfee found that online casinos are one of the most targeted types of business for cybercriminals, with criminals using a variety of methods to try and steal money from operators.

These include malware attacks, which can infect computers and allow criminals to gain access to sensitive data or even remotely control the devices; phishing attacks, which attempt to trick customers into revealing their passwords or other personal information; and social engineering scams, which typically involve contacting casino employees and attempting to get them to divulge confidential information.

According to McAfee’s report, the most common type of attack against online casinos is malware, which accounted for 43 percent of all attacks observed. This was followed by phishing (36 percent) and social engineering (13 percent).

Interestingly, the report also found that there is a distinct difference in the types of attacks targeting online casinos in different parts of the world. For example, while social engineering is the most common type of attack in North America, it accounts for only 3 percent of all attacks in Asia Pacific.

Meanwhile, phishing is more prevalent in Europe (45 percent) than anywhere else in the world. And while malware is the most common type of attack in Europe (49 percent), it is far less common in Asia Pacific (29 percent).

This highlights the importance of having a global cybersecurity strategy that takes into account the unique risks faced by different businesses around the world.
