#  Blackjack Pershing: The Man Who Got America's Enemy #1

In the early days of World War I, General John J. Pershing was charged with defeating the Central Powers, made up of Germany and its allies. He did so by leading the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) in Europe and routing the enemy in a number of historic battles. But his biggest achievement may have been capturing or killing the elusive "Beast of Berlin," General Erich von Ludendorff.

Ludendorff was one of the most prized targets of the AEF. He was seen as a mastermind behind Germany's war effort and was ultimately responsible for many of its military setbacks. After years of pursuit by Pershing and his men, Ludendorff was finally cornered and captured in November 1918—just two weeks before the end of the war.

Pershing's success against Ludendorff led to him being called "Blackjack" by his troops. The nickname stuck throughout his career, and he eventually became known as one of America's most distinguished military leaders.

A century ago, there was no better-known American general than John Joseph "Black Jack" Pershing. He led the American Expeditionary Forces in World War I and was one of the architects of the Allied victory. But ironically, his nickname was not earned on the battlefield but in a casino.

When Pershing was a young army officer, he was transferred to Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas. There he befriended a group of officers who liked to gamble, including one Colonel William R. ("Billy") Mitchell. The men would often play cards together, and Pershing soon became known as a skilled blackjack player.

One night in 1907, the group was playing cards at a casino in Juárez, Mexico when a fight broke out. Pershing was struck in the head with a bottle and sustained a concussion. He was rushed across the border to El Paso for treatment, where he remained unconscious for four days.

When he woke up, Pershing discovered that he had become something of a celebrity. His friends had spread word of his prowess at blackjack, and people were calling him "Black Jack." The nickname stuck, and Pershing went on to become one of America's most famous generals.
