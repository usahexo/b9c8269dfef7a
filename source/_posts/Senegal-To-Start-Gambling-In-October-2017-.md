#  Senegal To Start Gambling In October 2017 

After a long wait for the green light, Senegal is all set to start gambling in October 2017. The government of Senegal has finally given the go ahead for gambling to commence in the country from October this year. 

Senegal is located on the western coast of Africa. Casinos, betting shops and gaming arcades will all be legalized in Senegal by way of a decree passed by the government on June 2, 2017. This step has been taken to boost tourism in the country and create more jobs. 

The president of Senegal, Macky Sall, believes that legalizing gambling will provide new opportunities for the people of Senegal and help build a stronger economy. Gambling is expected to bring in revenue amounting to around $100 million per year. 

A number of casino operators are already lining up to set up shop in Senegal. These include MGM International, Hard Rock Cafe, Sun International and Golden Nugget. There are also plans to open a glitzy casino resort in Dakar, the capital city of Senegal. 

Betting on horse racing and other sports is already popular in Senegal. However, with the legalization of casinos and other forms of gambling, there is speculation that this could lead to an increase in crime rates as well. 

It remains to be seen how things will play out in Senegal once gambling is legalized later this year.

#  Gambling Set To Launch In Dakar, Senegal In Early October 

The government of Senegal has announced that gambling will officially launch in Dakar on October 1. The move is expected to provide a major boost to the local economy, with authorities projecting that the industry could generate as much as $1.5 billion in annual revenue.

Gambling has been legal in neighboring Mauritania for many years, and officials believe that Dakar can replicate that success by offering a wide range of games and betting options. Wagering is already allowed on horse racing and other sporting events, and it is expected that casinos, slot machines, and other traditional forms of gambling will also be popular among locals and tourists alike.

Senegal is not the only African country eyeing the potential benefits of gambling legalization. In 2017, Nigeria introduced a new bill that would regulate the industry and authorize the creation of new casinos. That measure is still pending approval by lawmakers, but if enacted it could potentially bring in billions of dollars in annual revenue.

While there are some who caution about the risks associated with gambling, most experts agree that properly managed, it can be a boon to local economies. With Africa's growing population and rising consumer demand, there is certainly potential for the gambling sector to continue expanding rapidly in the years ahead.

# Senegal Gears Up To Launch Gambling Sector 

Senegal, which is located on the west coast of Africa, is preparing to launch its gambling sector. The country’s government has been working on draft regulations for the past year, and they are now close to being finalized.

Once the regulations are in place, Senegal will become the latest African country to legalize gambling. This follows a trend that has seen a number of African countries move to regulate and legalize gambling in recent years.

This marks a significant change for Senegal, as gambling has previously been illegal in the country. However, there has been a strong push from the government to legalize it in order to boost economic growth.

According to officials, the gambling sector is expected to generate $100 million in annual revenue. This is seen as a major opportunity for the country, as it looks to attract more tourists and investors.

The draft regulations have been met with some criticism, however. Some people have raised concerns about the impact that gambling could have on society and public health. Others have voiced concerns that casinos could be used for money laundering or other criminal activities.

Despite these concerns, the government is moving ahead with plans to legalize gambling. This is seen as a major step forward for Senegal, and it is hoped that it will help to boost economic growth and create jobs in the country.

#  Senegal To Start Licensing Gambling Operators In September 2017 

Senegal is set to start licensing gambling operators in September 2017, according to a report by Reuters.

The country’s authorities believe that this will help to regulate the industry and generate extra income. Gambling is currently illegal in Senegal, but there are many unlicensed casinos and gaming venues operating throughout the country.

The new licensing system will be based on a series of permits, which will be granted to qualified applicants. The permits will be valid for a period of five years, and operators will be required to pay an annual fee of 10 million CFA francs (approximately $17,000). They will also be subject to regular inspections by the authorities.

The Minister of Youth and Sports, Matar Ba, said that the new system would protect young people from the dangers of gambling and would also create jobs. He added that the authorities were committed to fighting illegal gambling and that anyone caught operating without a permit would face stiff penalties.

According to Reuters, there are around 100 unlicensed casinos in Senegal, with most of them located in the capital, Dakar. The government believes that up to 500 jobs could be created by the new licensing system.

#  First Gambling License Issued In Senegal

Casinos and other gambling facilities have been a topic of hot debate in Senegal for years. Proponents of the facilities argue that they will bring much-needed jobs and revenue to the country, while opponents argue that they will lead to increased crime and social ills.

Now, it seems that the proponents have won out, as the first gambling license has been issued in Senegal. The license was granted to a company called SAVEMEX, which plans to open a casino in Dakar.

The granting of the license has generated a great deal of controversy. Some members of parliament are arguing that it should have been given to a Senegalese company rather than a foreign one. They also argue that there is not enough regulation in place to ensure that the gambling industry does not cause harm to society.

The president of SAVEMEX, Nicolas Pinto, defended the decision, saying that his company would adhere to all relevant laws and regulations. He also argued that his company would be providing much-needed jobs and revenue for the country.

Senegal is not the only African country to legalize gambling. In fact, several countries have done so in recent years. This is likely due to the many benefits that gambling can bring to a country, such as jobs and revenue.

However, it is important to note that there are also risks associated with gambling. Countries must make sure that they have in place strong regulations to protect consumers and society as a whole from any negative impacts of legalized gambling.
