# What are the Pai Gow rules?

The Pai Gow rules are very simple, but there is a fair amount of strategy involved in playing the game. The basic idea is to create two poker hands out of the seven cards that you are dealt - one five card hand and one two card hand. The five card hand must rank higher than the two card hand.

Your objective is to win both hands against the dealer's hands. If you win one hand and lose the other, or if both hands are ties, then you only get your bet back. If you lose both hands, then you lose your entire bet.

# How do I play?

In order to play Pai Gow, you first need to place a bet. You can either bet on each individual hand, or you can place a "combination" bet which will cover all possibilities - win both hands, lose both hands, or win one and tie the other.

After placing your bet, you are dealt seven cards face down. You then need to create two poker hands - a five card hand and a two card hand. The five card hand must rank higher than the two card hand.

Your objective is to win both hands against the dealer's hands. If you win one hand and lose the other, or if both hands are ties, then you only get your bet back. If you lose both hands, then you lose your entire bet.

# The different variations of Pai Gow


There are a few different variations of Pai Gow that you can find in casinos:

 
- Classic Pai Gow: This is the original version of the game where players try to make two poker hands - a five card hand and a two card hand. The five card hand must rank higher than the two card hand. 
- Progressive Pai Gow: In this variation, players are trying to make two poker hands - a five card hand and a four card hand. The four card hand must rank higher than the two card hand. 
- Chinese Poker: This version is similar to classic Paigow, but with some differences. In Chinese Poker, players are dealt thirteen cards instead of seven cards. They must then split these cards into three poker hands - one five card hand, one six-card hand and one three-card highstraight (Ace through six). Straights and flushes do not count in Chinese Poker. 

There are also some variations of Pai Gow that can be played online:

 
- Fortune Pai Gow Poker: This variation is similar to regular Pai Gow Poker, but features an optional bonus side Bet called " Fortune Bonus". If you make a Royal Flush with your first five cards (or 4-of-a-kind or straight flush), you automatically win the Fortune Bonus even if your opponent has better poker hands with their remaining cards). 
- Ultimate Texas Hold'em: In this variation, players compete against the dealer in a standard Texas Hold'em game plus an optional bonus side Bet called "Bonus". If players achieve certain rankings with their final five cards (e.g., Royal Flush), they win the Bonus payout

# How to play Pai Gow online?

Pai Gow is one of the oldest casino games that are still played today. The game is believed to have originated in China almost two thousand years ago. Pai Gow is a tile-based game that is similar to Mahjong. The game can be played with anywhere from two to six players. In Pai Gow, each player is dealt seven tiles. The players then take turns forming two hands using their tiles - a five-card poker hand and a two-card hand. The five-card hand must rank higher than the two-card hand. The player whose hands rank the highest wins the pot.

If you're interested in playing Pai Gow online, there are a few things you need to know. First, there are a number of different variations of the game available online, so make sure you understand the rules before you start playing. Also, make sure you're playing at a reputable site - there are plenty of scam sites out there that will just take your money without giving you anything in return.

When you're ready to start playing, head to the casino lobby and look for a Pai Gow table. You can usually find tables that accommodate anywhere from two to six players. Choose a table and click on it to join the game. Once you're seated, the dealer will give each player seven tiles and place the remaining tiles in the middle of the table.

The object of Pai Gow is to form two hands using your seven tiles - a five-card poker hand and a two-card hand. The five-card hand must rank higher than the two-card hand. Once all players have formed their hands, the dealer will reveal his or her cards and compare them against each player's hands. The player with the best five-card poker hand wins the pot, while the player with the best two-card hand loses any money they've bet on that particular round. If both hands are equal, then the pot is split between all winners equally.

# Playing Pai Gow online

Now that you know how to play Pai Gow, it's time to learn how to play it online! Like we said earlier, there are a number of different variations of this game available online, so make sure you understand the rules before you start playing. Most online casinos offer both American and European versions of Pai Gow, so be sure to choose the version that best suits your needs.

Also, be aware that not all casinos offer free play modes - some casinos require you to bet real money in order to play their games. So if you're new to Pai Gow or just want to practice for free before betting actual money, be sure to find an online casino that offers a free play mode first.

Once you've found an online casino that meets your needs, head over to their lobby and look for a Pai Gow table. You'll usually find tables that accommodate anywhere from 2-6 players. Choose a table and click on it to join the game (you may have to create an account if this is your first time playing at this casino). Once you're seated, the dealer will give each player seven tiles and place any remaining tiles in the middle of the table - this is where all betting takes place during this particular round of play).

     Now it's time for you to begin constructing your hands! We'll explain how this works below: 

   20% Hand: This is your low card kicker . Any 2 cards totaling less than 10 (e . g . 4 & 6) . This will only ever count as 1 card towards your 5 card poker hand .

    4 card Poker Hand: This will comprise any 3 cards from among those dealt face up plus either your 20% Hand or another 2 card combination totalling more than 10 giving 4 combinations possible altogether as shown :

  A ) { Ace , King } , { 2 , 3 }  OR { Ace , 2 } , { King , 3 } - Called either "Ace high" or "2 high" ;

 B ) { Ace , King } , { Jack , 10 }  OR { Ace , Jack } , { King , 10 } - Called either "Ace low" or "King low" ;

 C ) { Ace , King } , { 4 , 5 }  OR { Ace , 5 } ; { King ; 4 } – Pair Play as pair only ;

 D ) ANY other combination totalling 11+ using exactly 3 cards from among those dealt . This gives us 16 possible four card combinations altogether .

 5 Card Poker Hand :Combine any 3 different cards from among those dealt PLUS either your 20% Hand or another 2 card combination totalling more than 10 giving 5 combinations possible altogether as shown :

 E ) ANY pair using exactly 2 cards from among those dealt ; FIVE other possible 3 card combinations making 6 combinations in total from among those dealt .

# What is the objective of the game?

The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible. Points are earned by hitting the ball into designated areas of the court.

# What type of racquet do I need?

There is no specific type of racquet needed for this game; however, a light and flexible racquet is ideal.

# How do I serve the ball?

To serve the ball, stand with one foot behind the baseline and hold the racquet in your dominant hand. Swing your arm forward and snap your wrist to toss the ball into the air. As the ball approaches its highest point, hit it with your racquet. The ball should bounce once before you hit it back across the net.

# What are the basic rules of tennis?

Tennis has very simple rules - hit the ball over the net and into your opponent's side of the court. If they cannot hit it back, then you win a point. If they can hit it back, then you continue playing until someone misses or hits it out-of-bounds. The first player to reach six or seven points (depending on if it is a doubles or singles match), wins that game and scores a point for their team (or themselves). The first player to win four games wins the set, and if it is a best-of-three sets match, then they player must win two sets to win overall.

# What are good Pai Gow hands? 

There is no definitive answer to this question, as different players may have their own preferences, but there are some hands that are generally considered to be better than others. 

Some of the strongest Pai Gow hands include a five card straight, a five card flush, three of a kind, and a four card royal flush. While these hands offer some of the best odds, they can be difficult to form, so it is important to be aware of the other possible hands that can be played. 

Some of the weaker hands include two pair and one pair, but even these can provide some chances for winning if they are matched against weak hands from the dealer. In general, it is important to remember that the object of Pai Gow Poker is to create two winning hands out of the seven cards available, so any hand that offers a chance at victory should be played.

# What are the best Pai Gow tips?

The best Pai Gow tips are to always bet the banker and to only split Aces if you have another Ace to go with it. Playing these two tips will give you the best chance of winning at Pai Gow.

When playing the banker, you want to ensure that you are getting the best odds possible. The banker has a house edge of just over 1%, while the player has a house edge of over 2%. By betting on the banker, you are increasing your chances of winning while also reducing your chances of losing.

Splitting Aces is also a good idea, as long as you have another Ace to go with it. If you don’t have another Ace, then it’s best to keep them together. When splitting Aces, you should always bet equal amounts on each hand. This will give you the best chance of winning both hands and walking away with some extra cash.
