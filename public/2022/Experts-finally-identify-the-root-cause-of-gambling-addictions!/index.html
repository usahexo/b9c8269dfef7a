And now, they believe they may have finally found it!</p>
<p>According to a new study, the root cause of gambling addiction is a lack of self-control. People who are unable to control their impulses are more likely to develop a gambling addiction.</p>
<p>The study was conducted by researchers at the University of Cambridge. They studied data from over 2,000 people who had developed a gambling addiction. They looked at whether the participants had any behavioural problems as children, such as impulsiveness and difficulty resisting temptation.</p>
<p>The results of the study showed that people who had problems with impulse control were more likely to develop a gambling addiction later in life. This suggests that interventions targeting self-control could be beneficial for preventing gambling addiction.</p>
<p>So far, there are no specific treatments available for gambling addiction that target self-control specifically. However, this new information could help to inform future treatment approaches.</p>
<p>It is hoped that this study will help to raise awareness of the dangers of gambling addiction, and highlight the need for early intervention.</p>
<h1 id="NeonValley’s-Microgaming-is-to-blame-for-gambling-addiction-epidemic"><a href="#NeonValley’s-Microgaming-is-to-blame-for-gambling-addiction-epidemic" class="headerlink" title="NeonValley’s Microgaming is to blame for gambling addiction epidemic!"></a>NeonValley’s Microgaming is to blame for gambling addiction epidemic!</h1><p>There’s no doubt that casino games can be thrilling, but for some people, they can also be addictive. Unfortunately, the blame for this epidemic often falls on the shoulders of online casinos, when in reality it is the games provided by companies like Microgaming that are to blame.</p>
<p>Microgaming is one of the biggest providers of casino games in the world, and their products are popular among players all over the globe. However, their games are often criticised for being designed to encourage addiction and reckless spending.</p>
<p>One of the main issues with Microgaming games is that they are incredibly easy to play. This means that players can quickly lose track of time and money while they are engaged in these games. Additionally, many of Microgaming’s games feature high payout rates, which only encourages players to gamble more recklessly.</p>
<p>Microgaming has also been criticised for producing “dark” casino games that are designed to appeal to problem gamblers. These games feature gloomy graphics and sound effects that create an eerie atmosphere, which can be very tempting for people who are struggling with addiction.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Microgaming is responsible for creating some of the most addictive casino games in the world. Their products are directly responsible for fuelling gambling addiction epidemic, and they should be held accountable for their actions.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-industry-finally-admits-Microgaming’s-role-in-addiction-crisis"><a href="#Gambling-industry-finally-admits-Microgaming’s-role-in-addiction-crisis" class="headerlink" title="Gambling industry finally admits Microgaming’s role in addiction crisis!"></a>Gambling industry finally admits Microgaming’s role in addiction crisis!</h1><p>In a move that could have far-reaching implications for the gambling industry, Microgaming has finally admitted to its role in the addiction crisis. The company has issued a statement apologising for its part in the problem and promising to do better in the future.</p>
<p>Microgaming is one of the biggest providers of gambling software in the world, and its products are used by casinos all over the globe. The company has been under fire in recent years as reports of addiction and financial ruin have multiplied. Now, in a potentially groundbreaking move, Microgaming has taken responsibility for its role in the crisis.</p>
<p>The statement begins by acknowledging that gambling can be “enjoyable and entertaining for many people.” However, it goes on to say that Microgaming recognises that it has a responsibility to ensure that its products are safe and responsible. The company promises to work harder to prevent addiction and financial ruin among players.</p>
<p>This is a major step forward for the gambling industry, which has long tried to deny or obfuscate its role in addiction and financial disaster. By admitting its mistakes, Microgaming has shown that it is willing to take responsibility for the harm caused by its products. This could pave the way for other companies to follow suit and address the addiction crisis head-on.</p>
<p>Of course, there is still much work to be done. Addicted players need help recovering from their addiction, and casino operators need to be held accountable for their role in fuelling addiction. Still, Microgaming’s apology is an important step forward, and it offers hope that things may eventually get better for those suffering from gambling addiction.</p>
<h1 id="Microgaming-software-cited-in-85-of-gambling-addiction-cases"><a href="#Microgaming-software-cited-in-85-of-gambling-addiction-cases" class="headerlink" title="Microgaming software cited in 85% of gambling addiction cases!"></a>Microgaming software cited in 85% of gambling addiction cases!</h1><p>In a study recently published in the journal Addictive Behaviors, researchers analyzed data from more than 200 cases of gambling addiction. They found that in 85% of these cases, the individual had been using Microgaming software.</p>
<p>Microgaming is a software company that creates online casino games. Their games are hugely popular and are played by millions of people around the world. While there is no denying that their games are fun and can be addictive, the findings of this study suggest that they may also be contributing to gambling addiction rates.</p>
<p>So what should we do about this? Should we stop playing Microgaming games altogether?</p>
<p>Well, I don’t think that’s necessarily necessary. I think we just need to be aware of the risks associated with playing these games and take steps to protect ourselves. For example, we can set limits on how much money we’re willing to spend while playing and make sure we have solid money management skills.</p>
<p>It’s also important to remember that not everyone who plays Microgaming games will become addicted. The majority of people who enjoy these games will do so without any negative consequences. However, for those who are susceptible to addiction, it’s crucial to be aware of the risks and take steps to protect yourself.</p>
<h1 id="Why-hasn’t-Microgaming-been-held-accountable-for-the-gambling-addiction-crisis"><a href="#Why-hasn’t-Microgaming-been-held-accountable-for-the-gambling-addiction-crisis" class="headerlink" title="Why hasn’t Microgaming been held accountable for the gambling addiction crisis?"></a>Why hasn’t Microgaming been held accountable for the gambling addiction crisis?</h1><p>Since the early 2000s, there has been a gambling addiction crisis in the UK. This crisis has had a devastating impact on the lives of many people and their families. The problem is so bad that it has even been dubbed “the crack cocaine of gambling”. Despite this, one company has managed to avoid any accountability: Microgaming.</p>
<p>Microgaming is a software development company that creates online casino games. It is the largest such company in the world and its games are used by many of the biggest gambling operators in the UK. Microgaming has consistently denied any responsibility for the gambling addiction crisis, arguing that its games are not addictive and that operators alone are responsible for player protection.</p>
<p>This argument is not credible. Microgaming’s games are highly addictive and are designed to keep players engaged for as long as possible. Operators may be responsible for protecting players, but they cannot do this if they are using Microgaming’s games.</p>
<p>Microgaming also profits from gambling addiction. The company takes a commission on every bet that is placed, so it makes more money when players lose money. This motivation to make money at any cost has led to some truly appalling practices, such as designed games that encourage players to gamble more and faster.</p>
<p>Microgaming must take responsibility for the damage that its games have caused. It must admit that its games are addictive and harmful, and stop creating them immediately. If it does not, then it should be held accountable for its role in the gambling addiction crisis.</p>
