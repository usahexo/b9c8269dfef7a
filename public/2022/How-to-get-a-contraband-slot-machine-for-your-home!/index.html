<h1 id="How-to-win-at-a-contraband-slot-machine-every-time"><a href="#How-to-win-at-a-contraband-slot-machine-every-time" class="headerlink" title="How to win at a contraband slot machine every time!"></a>How to win at a contraband slot machine every time!</h1><p>Slot machines are one of the most popular casino games both in online and offline casinos. They are also one of the most unpredictable games since the outcome is generated randomly. However, there are some tricks that can help you win at a contraband slot machine every time. Here are some of them:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a machine that is not popular</li>
</ol>
<p>The first thing you need to do is choose a machine that is not popular. This is because the unpopular machines have fewer players playing on them, and hence, the chances of winning are higher. So, if you see a lot of people around a certain machine, it is best to avoid it.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Look for loose machines</li>
</ol>
<p>Another thing you need to do is look for loose machines. Loose machines payout more money as compared to tight ones. So, make sure you do your research and find out which machines are loose before playing on them.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Bet on max coins</li>
</ol>
<p>When playing on slot machines, always bet on max coins as this will give you the highest chance of winning the jackpot. If you don’t have enough money to cover all the bet lines, then reduce your bet amount but make sure you still bet on max coins.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-cheat-at-contraband-slot-machines"><a href="#How-to-cheat-at-contraband-slot-machines" class="headerlink" title="How to cheat at contraband slot machines!"></a>How to cheat at contraband slot machines!</h1><p> Did you know that you can cheat at contraband slot machines to get an edge over the house? All you need is a contraband token and a little bit of sleight of hand.</p>
<p>First, insert your contraband token into the machine. Then, press the spin button to start the reels spinning. While the reels are spinning, quickly take your contraband token out of the machine. This will cause the machine to think that you just spinned the reels, and it will award you with whatever payout is displayed on the screen.</p>
<p>Note that this technique only works with contraband slot machines. It will not work with regular slot machines. So be sure to scout out the casino floor for those prized contraband slots before you start cheating!</p>
<h1 id="How-to-make-a-contraband-slot-machine"><a href="#How-to-make-a-contraband-slot-machine" class="headerlink" title="How to make a contraband slot machine"></a>How to make a contraband slot machine</h1><p>This article will show you how to make your own contraband slot machine.</p>
<p>Materials needed:</p>
<p>-1 cabinet or other box that will hold the machine<br>-1 metal or plastic wheel that has at least 24 spokes<br>-hot glue gun and glue sticks<br>-ruler or tape measure<br>-xacto knife or sharp scissors<br>-marker or pencil</p>
<ol>
<li>To start, cut out a 6” square from the back of the cabinet using the xacto knife or sharp scissors. This will be where the machine goes. If you are using a different type of box, you will need to measure and cut accordingly.</li>
<li>Next, cut out a 9” diameter circle from one of the panels on the front of the cabinet. This will be where the wheel goes. You can use a ruler or tape measure to help with this step.3. Use the hot glue gun to attach the wheel to the center of the circle you just cut out. Make sure it is sturdy before moving on.4. Now it is time to make the machine itself! Cut out two identical rectangles measuring 3” wide x 5” long from cardboard or another heavy paper stock. These will be the sides of the machine.5. Next, cut out a 1” wide x 5” long rectangle from cardboard or other heavy paper stock. This will be the front of the machine and will have your contraband logo on it!6. Glue one of the 3” wide x 5” long rectangles to either side of the circle you cut out in step 2, making sure that they are both even with each other and level with the top edge of the circle.7. Glue the 1” wide x 5” long rectangle to the front of your machine, centered between the two larger rectangles you just glued on.8., Use a marker or pencil to draw three horizontal lines equally spaced apart on your wheel as shown in image A below.. These lines will help you line up your contraband slots later on.(If you are using a plastic wheel, you may want to use a permanent marker so that it doesn’t fade over time.)9., Now it is time to add your contraband slots! For each slot, poke two holes in each ofthe four corners as shown in image B below.(If you are using a plastic wheel, poke holes in each corner with a sharp object.)10., Use hot glue to attach one end of each spoke to one corner of each hole as shown in image C below.(Make sure not to get any glue on your wheel!)11., Do this for all 24 spokes on your wheel.(If using a plastic wheel, once all spokes are attached, cover entire wheel with several coatsof clear acrylic sealant to protect from UV damage and fading.)12.. Once everything is dry, put your machine in your cabinet and enjoy!</li>
