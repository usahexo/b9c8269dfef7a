        <h1 id="Sports-Betting-Could-Boost-The-Economy-By-17-4-Billion"><a href="#Sports-Betting-Could-Boost-The-Economy-By-17-4-Billion" class="headerlink" title="Sports Betting Could Boost The Economy By $17.4 Billion"></a>Sports Betting Could Boost The Economy By $17.4 Billion</h1><p>A recent study by Oxford Economics shows that legalizing sports betting could produce a nationwide economic impact of $17.4 billion over the next decade. That’s a pretty impressive figure, and it could lead to a lot of new jobs and tax revenue for states that legalize sports betting.</p>
<p>The study found that legalizing sports betting would create over 111,000 jobs nationwide, and it would generate more than $6.2 billion in tax revenue for federal, state, and local governments. This could be a major windfall for cash-strapped states, and it could help to shore up their budgets while also creating new jobs.</p>
<p>At the same time, the study found that there would be some costs associated with legalizing sports betting. This includes increased spending on problem gambling prevention programs and law enforcement efforts to combat illegal gambling operations. However, these costs are likely to be outweighed by the positive economic effects of legal sports betting.</p>
<p>The study is just the latest evidence that legal sports betting can be a major boon for the economy. Earlier this year, the American Gaming Association (AGA) released a report showing that legal sports betting could generate $261 million in tax revenue annually for federal and state governments. The AGA also estimates that legalized sport betting could create over 33,000 jobs nationwide.</p>
<p>These studies make a strong case for legalizing sports betting, and they should help to convince policymakers that this is a good idea from an economic standpoint. Legalizing sports betting will produce major benefits for states and for the economy as a whole, so it’s time to start thinking about how to make this happen.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Sportsbook-Revenue-Topped-4-5-Billion-In-2016"><a href="#Nevada-Sportsbook-Revenue-Topped-4-5-Billion-In-2016" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Sportsbook Revenue Topped $4.5 Billion In 2016"></a>Nevada Sportsbook Revenue Topped $4.5 Billion In 2016</h1><p>Nevada sportsbooks tallied $4.5 billion in revenue in 2016, a record and an increase of 3.6 percent from 2015, the Gaming Control Board said Tuesday.</p>
<p>“It was a good year,” Michael Lawton, senior research analyst with the control board, said of the $4.5 billion figure. “The increase came from all three gaming sectors: casino, poker and race and sports.”</p>
<p>Casino winnings totaled $3.3 billion in 2016, up from $3.1 billion in 2015; poker winnings were $194 million, up from $186 million; and race and sports wagering totaled $853 million, up from $812 million.</p>
<p>The average amount wagered on all sporting events last year was $528 million, up from $513 million in 2015. The largest bet on a single event was for more than $11 million on the Nov. 30 University of Oregon-University of Colorado football game.</p>
<p>On a percentage basis, football accounted for the most gambling action at 31 percent in 2016, down from 33 percent in 2015; basketball was second at 23 percent (down from 25 percent); baseball was third at 10 percent (up from 9 percent); and auto racing fourth at 5 percent (up from 4 percent).</p>
<p>The state collected almost $48 million in taxes on the sportsbooks’ revenue last year — 6percent of which went to Nevada’s education fund — compared with about $46 million in 2015. In all, state and local governments have taken in more than half a billion dollars in taxes since sports betting was legalized in Nevada in 1989.</p>
<h1 id="NBA-Commissioner-Adam-Silver-Discusses-The-Benefits-Of-Legalized-Sports-Betting"><a href="#NBA-Commissioner-Adam-Silver-Discusses-The-Benefits-Of-Legalized-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="NBA Commissioner Adam Silver Discusses The Benefits Of Legalized Sports Betting"></a>NBA Commissioner Adam Silver Discusses The Benefits Of Legalized Sports Betting</h1><p>In an appearance on ESPN’s Get Up, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said he believes legalized sports betting will result in tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue for the league. Silver also argued that such a move would help curtail illegal gambling operations and protect the integrity of the game.</p>
<p>Silver’s remarks come as several states consider legalizing sports betting in the wake of last year’s US Supreme Court decision to overturn a federal ban on the activity. Delaware, New Jersey, Mississippi, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania have all moved to legalize some form of sports betting in recent months, with more states expected to follow suit.</p>
<p>The NBA has been a vocal proponent of legalized sports betting and has lobbied for measures that would allow for a regulated market. In his appearance on Get Up, Silver said the league is “hopeful” that Congress will pass legislation this year that would authorize sports betting at the federal level.</p>
<p>Many observers believe legalized sports betting could be a boon for the league, with some estimating that it could generate up to $25 billion in annual revenue. That figure is considerably higher than the $7.4 billion generated by legal gambling on NBA games in 2017-18, according to industry analysts Eilers &amp; Krejcik Gaming LLC.</p>
<p>Legalized sports betting could also provide a much-needed boost to state and local governments, which are currently facing fiscal constraints. In New Jersey, for example, lawmakers expect legalized sports betting to generate more than $200 million in annual revenue.</p>
<p>Critics of legalized gambling argue that it is a threat to the integrity of sporting events and can lead to addiction and other social ills. But Silver dismissed those concerns on ESPN’s Get Up, arguing that regulated gaming is actually better for athletes and fans alike.</p>
<p>“It’s something that we’ve studied pretty extensively over many years now, and we continue to believe that it’s important for fans to have access to legal gaming as part of their overall entertainment experience when they’re watching games not only in our arenas but on television as well,” Silver said.</p>
<h1 id="Legal-Sports-Betting-Could-Create-Over-130-000-Jobs"><a href="#Legal-Sports-Betting-Could-Create-Over-130-000-Jobs" class="headerlink" title="Legal Sports Betting Could Create Over 130,000 Jobs"></a>Legal Sports Betting Could Create Over 130,000 Jobs</h1><p>Legal sports betting has the potential to create more than 130,000 jobs across the United States, a new study shows.</p>
<p>The study, conducted by the research firm Global Market Advisors (GMA), projects that legalizing and regulating sports betting could lead to the creation of 134,000 jobs by 2023. This would include nearly 10,000 jobs in New Jersey alone.</p>
<p>GMA’s findings come as a growing number of states are moving to legalize and regulate sports betting in the wake of last year’s landmark Supreme Court decision.</p>
<p>“The legalization and regulation of sports betting is having a major positive impact on state economies across the country,” said Damian Williams, President of GMA. “This is especially true in states that have already legalized it, where we are seeing thousands of new jobs being created and significant new tax revenue being generated.”</p>
<p>In New Jersey, which became the first state to legalize sports betting in June 2018, the industry is already creating jobs and generating tax revenue. In its first full month of operation (July 2018), New Jersey collected $3 million in taxes from legal sports bets. And according to a recent report from E Gaming Ventures, the industry is expected to create 1,600 full-time jobs in New Jersey by 2020.</p>
<p>Other states are seeing similar benefits from legal sports betting. In Mississippi, for example, the industry is expected to create 2,200 jobs and generate $167 million in tax revenue over the next five years. And in Pennsylvania, where online sports betting went live in November 2018, the industry is expected to create 4,500 jobs and generate over $300 million in tax revenue.</p>
<p>With so much at stake, it’s no surprise that a growing number of states are moving to legalize and regulate sports betting. To date, 11 states have legalized sports betting and another 10 are currently considering legislation.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-Governor-Tom-Wolf-Asks-For-Passage-Of-Sports-Gambling-bill"><a href="#Pennsylvania-Governor-Tom-Wolf-Asks-For-Passage-Of-Sports-Gambling-bill" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf Asks For Passage Of Sports Gambling bill"></a>Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf Asks For Passage Of Sports Gambling bill</h1><p>Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf has recently come out in support of a new bill that would legalize sports gambling within the state. The move is seen as an effort by the governor to bolster the state’s finances, which have taken a hit in recent years. In a statement, Wolf said that he hoped the bill would help to create jobs and grow the economy.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania is one of several states where sports gambling is currently illegal. However, that could soon change, as a number of states have been moving to legalize the practice in recent months. In 2018, the Supreme Court struck down a federal law that banned sports gambling nationwide, paving the way for individual states to decide whether to legalize it or not.</p>
<p>So far, 11 states have taken up legislation to legalize sports gambling, while a number of others are still considering it. The move is seen as a potentially lucrative one for states, as sports gambling generates billions of dollars in annual revenue. In addition, it can create jobs in the casino and tourism industries.</p>
<p>Supporters of legalized sports gambling say that it can also be beneficial for consumers, who now have more options when it comes to betting on sporting events. They argue that it can be done in a responsible manner and that it can help to boost fan interest in sporting events.</p>
<p>Opponents of legalized sports gambling say that it can lead to addiction and other social problems. They also argue that it can hurt the integrity of sporting events if they are perceived as being fixed.</p>
