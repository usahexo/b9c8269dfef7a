Pershing was charged with defeating the Central Powers, made up of Germany and its allies. He did so by leading the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) in Europe and routing the enemy in a number of historic battles. But his biggest achievement may have been capturing or killing the elusive “Beast of Berlin,” General Erich von Ludendorff.</p>
<p>Ludendorff was one of the most prized targets of the AEF. He was seen as a mastermind behind Germany’s war effort and was ultimately responsible for many of its military setbacks. After years of pursuit by Pershing and his men, Ludendorff was finally cornered and captured in November 1918—just two weeks before the end of the war.</p>
<p>Pershing’s success against Ludendorff led to him being called “Blackjack” by his troops. The nickname stuck throughout his career, and he eventually became known as one of America’s most distinguished military leaders.</p>
<h1 id="How-Blackjack-Pershing-Became-Known-As-Black-Jack"><a href="#How-Blackjack-Pershing-Became-Known-As-Black-Jack" class="headerlink" title="How Blackjack Pershing Became Known As Black Jack"></a>How Blackjack Pershing Became Known As Black Jack</h1><p>A century ago, there was no better-known American general than John Joseph “Black Jack” Pershing. He led the American Expeditionary Forces in World War I and was one of the architects of the Allied victory. But ironically, his nickname was not earned on the battlefield but in a casino.</p>
<p>When Pershing was a young army officer, he was transferred to Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas. There he befriended a group of officers who liked to gamble, including one Colonel William R. (“Billy”) Mitchell. The men would often play cards together, and Pershing soon became known as a skilled blackjack player.</p>
<p>One night in 1907, the group was playing cards at a casino in Juárez, Mexico when a fight broke out. Pershing was struck in the head with a bottle and sustained a concussion. He was rushed across the border to El Paso for treatment, where he remained unconscious for four days.</p>
<p>When he woke up, Pershing discovered that he had become something of a celebrity. His friends had spread word of his prowess at blackjack, and people were calling him “Black Jack.” The nickname stuck, and Pershing went on to become one of America’s most famous generals.</p>
<h1 id="How-General-Pershing-Became-A-Nickname"><a href="#How-General-Pershing-Became-A-Nickname" class="headerlink" title="How General Pershing Became A Nickname"></a>How General Pershing Became A Nickname</h1><p>There are many nicknames for people in the military. Among the most popular are “Sarge,” “Gunny,” and “General.” But where do these names come from?</p>
<p>One of the most famous nicknames in the military is General Pershing. This nickname is derived from the name of John J. Pershing, who was a general during World War I. He was a highly respected leader and is still considered to be one of the most talented generals in American history.</p>
<p>John J. Pershing was born on September 13th, 1860 in Laclede, Missouri. After graduating from West Point, he served in several important military positions throughout his career. In 1917, he was appointed as the commander of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) in France.</p>
<p>Under his leadership, the AEF played a significant role in defeating the Germans on the battlefield. In addition, his efforts helped to establish the United States as a major player in World War I. For his accomplishments, General Pershing received many prestigious awards including the Distinguished Service Cross and the French Légion d’honneur.</p>
<p>After returning home from World War I, General Pershing continued to serve in various military positions until his retirement in 1924. He passed away on July 15th, 1948 at the age of 87.</p>
<p>Despite being deceased for over 60 years, General Pershing’s name still resonates with many people in America. This is largely due to his impressive accomplishments as a general during World War I. Additionally, his nickname - General Pershing - has remained popular throughout the years and is still used by many people in the military today.</p>
<h1 id="Blackjack-Pershing-A-General-With-Many-Names"><a href="#Blackjack-Pershing-A-General-With-Many-Names" class="headerlink" title="Blackjack Pershing - A General With Many Names"></a>Blackjack Pershing - A General With Many Names</h1><p>John Joseph Pershing was born on a farm near Laclede, Missouri, on September 13, 1860. He was the son of a farmer and Civil War veteran who had served with the Union army. Young Pershing developed a strong sense of discipline and patriotism from his father. He attended school in Laclede, then at fourteen entered West Point.</p>
<p>After graduating from West Point in 1886, Second Lieutenant Pershing was assigned to the Fourth Cavalry Regiment at Fort Huachuca in Arizona. In 1890 he was made a captain and transferred to the Philippines, where he fought in the Spanish-American War (1898). After the war he remained in the Philippines as military advisor to the Philippine government.</p>
<p>In 1902 Captain Pershing returned to the United States and took command of a cavalry regiment at Fort Bliss, Texas. In 1906 he was promoted to brigadier general and made commander of the Eighth Cavalry Brigade at Camp Beauregard, Louisiana.</p>
<p>In 1916 General Pershing was named commander of American forces in Europe during World War I (1914-1918). He quickly built up an impressive record, leading his troops from one victory to another. His most famous victory came at the Battle of Saint-Mihiel, in which American and French forces crushed a large German army.</p>
<p>After the war General Pershing led the American occupation of Germany. He retired from active duty in 1924 but remained involved with military affairs as head of the Army Board of Generals and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He died on July 15, 1948, and was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery.</p>
<p>General John J. “Blackjack” Pershing is one of America’s most celebrated military leaders. But his life was more than just a series of battlefield successes. He was also a skilled administrator and diplomat who helped shape America’s role in world affairs.</p>
<h1 id="How-General-Blackjack-Got-His-Nickname"><a href="#How-General-Blackjack-Got-His-Nickname" class="headerlink" title="How General Blackjack Got His Nickname"></a>How General Blackjack Got His Nickname</h1><p>The story of how General Blackjack got his nickname is a famous one in the annals of American military history. It is a tale that has been passed down for generations and one that is still recounted to this day.</p>
<p>Born in 1784, General Blackjack was a renowned military leader who fought in many wars throughout his career. He is best known for his role in the Battle of New Orleans during the War of 1812. In that battle, he led his troops to a decisive victory against the British forces, earning him the nickname of “General Blackjack”.</p>
<p>This nickname would follow him throughout the rest of his illustrious career. He would go on to fight in other famous battles, such as the Mexican-American War and the American Civil War. He also served as the Governor of Tennessee from 1849 to 1851.</p>
<p>General Blackjack died in 1876 at the age of 92, leaving behind a legacy as one of America’s most celebrated military leaders.
